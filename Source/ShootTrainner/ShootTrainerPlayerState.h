/**
 * @enum EOverlappingState
 * @brief Represents the state of overlap events between Actors.
 *
 * This enum is intended to be used like a simple state machine
 * for handling overlap logic. Instead of relying on multiple 
 * boolean flags, the enum tracks the current overlap state in 
 * a clear and extendable way.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * - @c None    : No overlap is currently occurring.
 * - @c Started : The overlap event has just begun (OnActorBeginOverlap).
 * - @c Ended   : The overlap event has just ended (OnActorEndOverlap).

## 🎯 ShootTrainer Core Game Logic

This repository contains the core C++ source files for managing the **game state, player mechanics, weapons, and challenges** in the **ShootTrainer** project. These foundational classes and structures define the gameplay flow essential for a first-person shooting training simulator.

## ⚙️ Key C++ Components

### 1\. Game State and Data

| Class/Struct | Role | Key Properties/Methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`AShootTrainnerGameState`** | Server-side object managing shared session data. | **`Challenges`**: Stores `TArray<FChallenge>` for the session. |
| **`FChallenge`** | Defines a single training exercise. | **`Difficulty`**, **`Name`**, **`TimeLimit`**, **`ScoreMultiplier`**. |
| | | **`EvaluatePerChallengeAccuracy(float distance)`** method. |
| **`AShootTrainerPlayerState`** | Tracks per-player stats and performance. | **`Accuracy`**, **`ShotsFiredCount`**, **`TargetHit`**, **`TimePlayed`**. |
| | | **`EvaluateAccuracy(TArray<float> Accuracies)`** method. |

### 2\. Player and World Interaction

| Class | Role | Key Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`AShootTrainnerCharacter`** | Represents the player in the world. | Handles movement, camera, **weapon states** (Armed, Firing, Aiming), input binding, and interaction. |
| **`AChallengeGate`** | Defines the entry point for a challenge. | Uses an overlap box (`GateTrigger`) to detect players, displays optional UI (`ChallengeWidget`), and starts the challenge upon player **`Interact`** (E). |
| **`AWeapon`** | Base class for all firearms. | Manages firing, **ammo**, `MagazineSize`, **pickup**, and effects (`NiagaraComponent`). |
| **`ABullet`** | Represents the projectile. | Uses `UProjectileMovementComponent` for flight and handles collision. |
| **`ATarget`** | Base class for all shooting targets. | Tracks **`Hits`**, **`Impact`** location, **`distance`** from the player, and handles collision with bullets. |

## 📜 Enumerators (Enums)

These enums standardize key states and values, making the logic predictable and accessible to Blueprints.

| Enumerator | Purpose | Key Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`EPlayerState`** | Player's current activity. | `FreeRoam`, `Challenge` |
| **`EDifficultyLevel`** | Pre-set challenge difficulty. | `VeryEasy` → `Insane` |
| **`EOverlappingState`** | Tracking actor overlap events. | `None`, `Started`, `Ended` |

## ⌨️ Default Input Mappings

The player character binds the following actions to control movement, combat, and interaction:

| Action | Key / Button | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Move** | `WASD` | Player movement |
| **Look** | `Mouse` | Camera rotation |
| **Jump** | `Space` | Player jump |
| **Fire** | `Left Mouse Button` | Shoot weapon |
| **Aim** | `Right Mouse Button` | Aim down sights |
| **Reload** | `R` | Reload weapon |
| **Interact** | `E` | Pick up items / start challenge |
| **Drop** | `Q` | Drop equipped weapon |
| **Play** | `P` | Start challenge manually |
| **Exit** | `Esc` | Exit challenge |

## 📁 Project Structure

The C++ source code is organized into logical directories within the `Source/` folder:

```
ShootTrainner/
├─ Config/             # UE5 configuration files
├─ Source/             # C++ source files
├─ ShootTrainner.uproject
└─ README.md
```

**Note:** This repository provides a code-only reference implementation. All core gameplay logic—including player stats, challenge mechanics, and weapon handling—is implemented entirely in **C++**. Blueprints are not included but can be used to extend these classes.

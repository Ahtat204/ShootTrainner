Step-by-Step Development Plan for UE5 Pistol Shooting Trainer
Step 1: Basic Project Setup & Player Controller
Create a new UE5 project (First Person Template is a good start).

Set up a simple pistol weapon for the player:

Basic shooting mechanic (raycast/line trace for bullet hit).

Ammo count display (HUD widget).

Reload mechanic (simple press to reload).

Implement basic aiming and shooting animation (can be simple for now).

Step 2: Target System - Static Targets
Create a static target actor:

Bullseye or simple shape.

Implement hit detection (hit event triggered when shot).

Spawn multiple targets in the shooting range.

Add scoring for hitting targets (simple points per hit).

Show hit feedback (e.g., sound + particle effect on hit).

Step 3: Moving & Pop-up Targets
Extend target system:

Add movement: targets move left-right or back-forth on a timeline.

Add pop-up targets that appear/disappear on a timer.

Randomize target appearance timing and position to increase difficulty.

Step 4: Scoring System & UI
Implement a scoring system:

Points for hits, bonus points for bullseyes.

Penalty points for missed shots or hitting no-shoot targets.

Create a HUD widget that shows:

Current score.

Ammo count.

Timer (optional for timed modes).

Step 5: Shooting Modes
Implement different game modes:

Precision mode (score based on accuracy).

Speed mode (score based on how fast player shoots all targets).

Tactical mode (player moves between cover and shoots targets).

Allow mode selection from a main menu or UI.

Step 6: Target Variety & Penalties
Add no-shoot (hostage) targets with penalties.

Add different target sizes (small vs large) with different point values.

Add moving targets with more complex paths.

Step 7: Post-Training Feedback
Record shot locations and timestamps.

Create a heatmap or simple UI graph to show shot distribution.

Show stats summary (accuracy, time, hits/misses) at the end of each round.

Step 8: Gun Mechanics & Realism
Implement realistic reload animations and timing.

Add recoil system affecting the camera or aim.

Add weapon customization (attachments like laser sight or different grips).

Step 9: AI Instructor / Voice Feedback
Add a simple voice or text-based AI instructor.

Trigger feedback based on player performance (e.g., “Try to reload faster!”).

Step 10: Advanced Environment & Challenges
Implement night mode with flashlights.

Add obstacles and cover points in the training range.

Create challenge levels with timed target appearances and penalties.

Step 11: Polish & Optimization
Add Niagara particle effects for bullet impacts.

Add sound effects for gunshots, target hits, and UI feedback.

Optimize target spawning using object pooling.

Polish animations and UI transitions.

Step 12: Final Packaging & Deployment
Test the game thoroughly.

Package for your target platform (PC, Android via Unity maybe later).

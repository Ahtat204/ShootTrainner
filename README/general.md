🎯 Core Gameplay Ideas
Multiple Target Types:

Static targets

Moving targets (left-right, back-forth)

Pop-up targets with randomized timing

Hostage/No-shoot targets to penalize accuracy

Shooting Modes:

Precision Mode: Focus on accuracy (scoring based on bullseye hits)

Speed Mode: Timed challenges, fastest takedown wins

Tactical Mode: Move between cover and shoot targets with reload management

Scoring System:

Hit accuracy

Reaction time

Target priority (some targets give more points)

🔁 Progression & Replayability
Training Courses:

Create multiple lanes or rooms with increasing difficulty

Unlock new rooms or weapons as the player progresses

Rank & Medals System:

Bronze, Silver, Gold ratings per course

Global rank meter (e.g., Beginner → Elite Marksman)

Custom Training Mode:

Allow player to configure number and speed of targets

Time constraints, accuracy thresholds

🧠 Learning & Feedback Systems
Post-Training Analysis:

Heatmap of where shots landed

Shot grouping and spread

Accuracy over time graphs

Coach Bot or AI Instructor:

Gives feedback like: “You’re too slow on the draw” or “Aim for center mass”

Maybe even a holographic instructor (Blueprint or Sequencer cutscenes)

⚙️ Advanced Mechanics (Optional)
Gun Mechanics:

Realistic reload (slide, mag eject, bullet in chamber)

Recoil system and aim drift

Customizable weapons (sight, grip, laser)

VR/First-Person Enhancements:

Use IK for hand alignment and grip

Optional slow-mo effect to help train reactions

📊 UI/UX Ideas
HUD Display:

Ammo count, timer, hit count

Visual feedback for missed shots (highlighted targets)

Bullet Cam (optional):

For "perfect" shots, show bullet trajectory like in Sniper Elite (cinematic)

🏋️‍♂️ Extra Challenge Modes
Night Training:

Low-light environment with flashlight or night vision

Obstacle Course:

Move and shoot while avoiding barriers or “tripwires”

Reflex Challenge:

Targets appear briefly and vanish—perfect for twitch aim training

🔧 Technical Bonus Opportunities
Data-driven target spawns using DataTables

Niagara particles for bullet impacts, dust, spark

Sound system with spatial feedback for shot direction

C++ + Blueprint Hybrid: base systems in C++, exposed to Blueprint for flexibility
